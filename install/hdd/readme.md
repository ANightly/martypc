### HDD Directory

This directory will store the VHDs created by the emulator.

VHDs in this directory will be selectable via a menu from within MartyPC.

Currently, only one type of VHD is supported, limited by the largest geometry
the IBM/Xebec drive controller was able to support. In the future as IDE 
support is added larger drives will be available.
