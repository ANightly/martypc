### Rom Directory

Place your ROMs in this directory. Subdirectories will not be searched.
The name of the roms is not important - MartyPC will find ROMs it knows about by their md5 hash.

Most common sources of IBM BIOS images for the IBM PC 5150 or IBM XT 5160 should work, including basic ROMs.
If multiple valid sets of ROMs are detected, MartyPC will use the newest set by release date.

Please see the MartyPC Wiki for more information on using ROMs with MartyPC.
