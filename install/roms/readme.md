### Rom directory

Place your roms in this directory. Subdirectories will not be searched.
The name of the roms is not important - MartyPC will find ROMs it knows about by their md5 hash.

Eventually, I will have config options to specify a custom ROM without a definition, but 
currently MartyPC can only load ROMs it knows about. 

Any of the official IBM BIOS images for the IBM PC 5150 or IBM XT 5160 should work, including basic ROMs.
If multiple valid sets of ROMs are detected, MartyPC will use the newest set by release date.
